HDXer tutorials
==============================
This directory contains tutorials, accompanying data, and example results for various applications of the HDXer package. Each tutorial can be run within a self-contained Jupyter notebook, provided you have successfully [installed the HDXer package](https://github.com/Lucy-Forrest-Lab/HDXer/blob/master/README.md) in your Python environment.

All input data required to complete the tutorials is provided within this repository. However, in [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/Lucy-Forrest-Lab/HDXer/blob/master/tutorials/notebooks/02_calc_hdx.ipynb) you are also given the option to recreate the input data using the trajectories provided in [this Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4640760). It's not compulsory to download these trajectories, but you may find it useful, for example to check your understanding of the process, or to explore other HDXer functionalities.
