    "In the previous notebook, we calculated the predicted HDX-MS data for a candidate ensemble of BPTI structures taken from unbiased MD trajectories. We discovered that, for some backbone amides, the `BestVendruscolo` predictive model provided a good estimate of the experimental HDX-MS data, but substantial differences remained between theory and experiment for many residues. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few notebooks, we'll reduce those discrepancies by applying maximum entropy ensemble reweighting, and evaluate the effects of reweighting upon the relative populations of BPTI conformations present in the candidate ensemble. Ultimately, we weill identify a final, reweighted, conformational ensemble that best conforms to the experimental HDX-MS data, taking into account all sources of uncertainty in the fitting of theory and experiment.\n",

    "Conceptually, the value of $\\gamma$ is related to the level of uncertainty included in the reweighting of the candidate ensemble to fit the target data. Equation 7 of [Bradshaw, Marinelli et al.](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(20)30124-7) contains details of the quantitative meaning of $\\gamma$, but we'll also provide a qualitative explanation of why its a crucial parameter for reweighting below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of $\\gamma$ and the level of uncertainty included within a reweighting analysis are inversely related. Conceptually then, as the $\\gamma$ value is increased, a greater bias will be applied to the underlying ensemble, the reweighting will fit more tightly to the target data, and the error between the final predicted HDX-MS and the target experimental HDX-MS data will be reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, reliable data fitting requires robustness checks. Overfitting, in which the predicted and target data agree more precisely than the true level of uncertainty in the target data, can readily occur. The 'true' uncertainty in our reweighting arises from multiple different sources, and hence we don't know the 'correct' value of $\\gamma$ to use *a priori*. We therefore perform multiple reweighting analyses, each with a unique $\\gamma$ value, and select the optimal $\\gamma$ value using some common heuristics. This will generate a robust final reweighted structural ensemble for further analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore a range of $\\gamma$ values from $1*10^{-3}$ to $9*10^{0}$. In our experience this range is typically suitable for applications of HDXer to reweight biomolecular MD simulations, but when first designing experiments for a new system we recommend exploring as wide a range of $\\gamma$ values as possible, to ensure you've fully characterized the level of uncertainty present in your own analyses."
