    "Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) is a popular biophysical tool used to study the structure and dynamics of proteins in their native or near-native environments. Typically, HDX experiments are designed to measure the exchange of protein backbone amide hydrogen atoms for deuterium atoms from a bulk deuterated solution. The rate of H-D exchange is governed by chemical factors, such as steric and inductive effects of the neighboring sidechains upon the amide functional group, and by physical factors, such as structural and dynamical protection afforded by the equilibrium motions of the protein in solution. Measuring, comparing, and rationalizing rates of exchange can therefore provide insights into the structures and dynamics of proteins under a desired set of environmental conditions. Deuterium labeling from H-D exchange can be measured directly by biophysical tools such as NMR, but most recently has been popularized with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), which avoids many limitations of protein size, concentration, and throughput, associated with other experimental techniques."

    "The experimental HDX data for BPTI were first reported (in the articles above by Woodward and coworkers) as observed H-D exchange rate constants for each amide, measured by NMR. However, rate constants for individual residues were variously measured at different temperatures and pD values. Persson & Halle converted the observed rate constants to equivalent temperature and pD measurements, and then reported the same data as an experimental 'protection factor' for each residue. The protection factor (PF, or $P_i$) is a unitless constant that describes the extent to which a residue's _intrinsic_ rate of exchange is modulated by the structure and dynamics of its environment. **HDXer** requires input experimental data formatted as peptide-segment deuterated fractions at given points in time, as this is the more frequent experimental observable from HDX-MS experiments.

    "As you can see, residues in BPTI exhibit a wide range of protection factors, which results in a wide range of deuterated fraction values under experimental conditions of pD 7.4 and 298 K. Some residues exchange almost immediately, after 10 s labeling time, while many others remain protected even after 2 hours of D$_2$O labeling.\n",
